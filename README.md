# PI - Bot

Inspired by https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-to-build-a-robot-that-sees-with-100-and-tensorflow

I built a robot using many of the components listed in that blog post.

The python code in this project includes
* Drive.py: a module for controlling the motors' speed
* Sonar.py: a module for reading distance measurements from the sonar sensors
* Avoid.py: a module that implements an avoid obstacles behavior
* robot.py: a simple CLI for driving the robot
